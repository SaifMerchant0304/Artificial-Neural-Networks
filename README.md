### Artificial-Neural-Networks

- **Aviation Industry Project Summary:**
  - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various parameters.
  - **Data Description:**
    - Contains flight information such as airline, source, destination, duration, stops, and price.
  - **Steps and Tasks:**
    1. **Data Import and Understanding:**
       - Read 'Data.xlsx' into a DataFrame and import required libraries.
       - Check for missing values and print percentage for each attribute.
       - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis on the dataset.
       - Visualize the correlation matrix of features with color coding.
       - Share insights from initial data analysis.
    2. **Data Preprocessing:**
       - Split the data into X & Y.
       - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets with a 70:20:10 proportion.
       - Normalize the training, validation, and test data.
       - Transform labels into a format acceptable by the Neural Network.
    3. **Model Training & Evaluation using Neural Network:**
       - Design a Neural Network for training the model.
       - Train the model using appropriate parameters.
       - Plot visuals for training loss vs. validation loss and training accuracy vs. validation accuracy.
       - Update existing architecture to improve model performance.
       - Plot visuals for both model architectures and share insights.

- **Automotive Industry Project Summary:**
  - **Objective:** Develop a model to predict the price of used cars.
  - **Data Description:**
    - Utilizes the cars dataset from Kaggle, including features like brand/model, year, transmission, mileage, price, and color.
  - **Steps and Tasks:**
    1. **Data Import and Exploration:**
       - Read 'usedcars.csv' file and import required libraries.
       - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.
       - Create and visualize a correlation matrix for all features.
       - Check for and remove outliers.
       - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    2. **Data Preprocessing:**
       - Convert categorical features to numerical features.
       - Normalize the dataset using an appropriate method.
    3. **Model Training & Evaluation using Neural Network:**
       - Design a Neural Network for training the model.
       - Train the model using suitable parameters.
       - Evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics.
       - Plot training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, and validation accuracy vs. number of epochs.
       - Update or design new architecture to improve model performance.
       - Plot visuals for both model architectures and share insights.

In both projects, the aim is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop predictive models. The Aviation Industry project focuses on predicting flight prices, while the Automotive Industry project centers around predicting the prices of used cars. Each project involves steps such as data import, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and potential architecture updates for enhanced performance. Through comprehensive analysis and iterative model development, the goal is to create accurate predictive models that can benefit the respective industries.
